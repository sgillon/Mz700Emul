/// <summary>
/// Sharp MZ-1X03 joystick port emulation. Two sticks, each with X/Y
/// axes (0-255) and two pushbutton switches. Behaviour matches the
/// MZ-1X03 instruction manual:
///
/// $E008 bits 1-6 are joystick lines, multiplexed by VBLK through a
/// 74LS157:
///   - VBLK low (visible portion): bits 1-4 carry axis 555-timer
///     pulse outputs. After VBLK falls, each bit goes low for a
///     duration proportional to the corresponding axis position,
///     then back to high. The MZ-1X03's reading routine waits for
///     VBLK to fall, then counts CPU cycles while the bit is low,
///     yielding a 0-255 value.
///   - VBLK high (vertical blanking): bits 1-4 carry SW1/SW2 of
///     each stick (active-low: 0 = pressed).
///
/// All bits idle at 1 (active-low pull-ups). Sticks with
/// <see cref="StickState.Active"/> = false are treated as
/// disconnected — their bits stay at 1, so games like panic.mzf
/// that direct-read $E008 see "no input" rather than spurious
/// pulses or button presses.
///
/// Bit→stick mapping (per MZ-1X03 manual):
///   bit 1 = stick 1 X-axis pulse | stick 1 SW1
///   bit 2 = stick 1 Y-axis pulse | stick 1 SW2
///   bit 3 = stick 2 X-axis pulse | stick 2 SW1
///   bit 4 = stick 2 Y-axis pulse | stick 2 SW2
///   bits 5, 6 = unused (always 1)

    // Pulse-low duration per axis-value unit. Calibrated against the
    // joystick-read routine in panic.mzf ($2220), which is the most
    // demanding consumer we have a full disassembly of. That routine,
    // after the VBLK falling edge, samples each axis bit at two fixed
    // cycle offsets — ~1490 and ~7390 Z80 cycles — and counts how many
    // samples caught the pulse still low (0 = axis low/left-up, 1 =
    // centre, 2 = axis high/right-down).
    //
    // For a centred axis (128) to read as "1" the pulse must end
    // between the two samples, and for a full-deflection axis (255) to
    // read as "2" it must still be low past 7390 cycles:
    //   128 * C  in (1490, 7390)  ->  C in (11.6, 57.7)
    //   255 * C  >   7390         ->  C >  29.0
    // The lower the value within that window, the more symmetric the
    // left/centre/right split, and the closer the BASIC JOY() function
    // (whose count loop is ~33 cycles/iteration) tracks 0..255. 33
    // sits just above panic's hard floor: full-right gives 255*33 =
    // 8415 cycles (1025-cycle / ~31-unit margin past the 7390 sample),
    // while centre gives 4224 — comfortably mid-window.
    //
    // Earlier guesses: 28 (too low — 255*28 = 7140 missed panic's
    // second sample, RIGHT/DOWN never detected) and 64 (too high — a
    // centred 128*64 = 8192 already passed the second sample, so centre
    // read as full RIGHT/DOWN).
