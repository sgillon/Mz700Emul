# MZRaku

A Sharp MZ-700 emulator written in C# / .NET 8 (WinForms). The aims of this emulator are:

1. Work well enough play the MZ-700 games I remember from my childhood
2. Be useable from a launcher such as Launchbox or Playnite, taking into account the need for a lot of games to have BASIC present before they can be loaded

This means that the goal is for the emulator to work 'well enough', and with some quality-of-life features to enable the above, without necessarily worrying too much about accurately reproducing how the actual MZ-700 hardware works. A good example of this is that MZRaku **does not** emulate the MZ-1T01 cassette drive. Cassette images (regardless of type) are loaded by directly injecting them into the MZ-700's memory, which meets the objective of loading games quickly and easily.

***
IMPORTANT NOTE - The emulator code is *entirely* AI generated. Although I have some development experience, how CPUs etc work is outside my skillset so what is here is a result of several weeks of me working with Claude to produce the features and refinements I need for my use case. I chose to use C# as it is a language I know, so I can use how the project has been put together to educate myself on what it takes to create an emulator. The choice to use WinForms, effectively tying the current implementation tightly to Windows, was also made as it suits my specific needs.

Another aim was to see whether something like this is even possible using an AI tool. I think the result is pretty impressive. It's not perfect, but it does work. I think this is an appropriate use of these tools. I don't think anyone would be using a trivial emulator such as this for anything critical to their lives.

## Status

The emulator runs most MZ-700 software and games, in both BASIC and machine code. There are some [outstanding limitations](#known-limitations) and things that aren't quite right. These are listed further down this file.

- Cassette images in `.mzf`/`.m12`/`.mzt` formats can be loaded via the menu, dragging and dropping them into the emulator window, or by specifying them on the command-line — the emulator will inspect the MZF and load BASIC and type 'RUN' automatically, if that is required to run the program. Machine-code programs are loaded and started directly.
- If your `.mzf`/`.m12`/`.mzt` files are within .zip archives, these can also be used directly in the same way as above. The emulator will automatically extract the .mzf file from the archive and run it.
- The default keyboard layout maps appropriate PC keys to the MZ-700 character set - e.g. typing a '+' on the PC keyboard will generate a '+' in the emulator, even though those keys are in relatively-different positions on actual hardware. An editor for the keyboard mappings is available under `File->Settings` if you would like to change to alternative mappings.
- MZRaku emulates the MZ-1X03 joystick via any Windows-recognised game controller. Button mappings can be changed via `File->Settings`
- Text files containing BASIC listings can be loaded. These are auto-typed into the emulator at about 6-8 chars per second. (Speeding this up will be a future focus)
- The running of Frank Cringle's Z80 instruction set exerciser (ZEXDOC/ZEXALL) is integrated into MZRaku and all tests pass. The harness can be run from `Debug → Run Z80 Test…` at any time using the supplied `tools/CPM/zexdoc.com` / `zexall.com`. 




## Quickstart

The emulator itself is freely available, but i have not included the MZ-700 ROM & font files or the S-BASIC .mzf, all of which are really required to make the emulator useful. Other emulators seem to have included these, so I'm not necessarily worried about Sharp taking action, more about any Github rules and associated automated scanning that might make including them in the repo problematic.

You'll need to source the three required files yourself (they are widely archived online) and drop them into the install directory:

| File | Where it goes | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `1z-013a.rom` | `roms\` | The MZ-700 monitor ROM (4 KiB). |
| `mz700fon.int` | `roms\` | The character-generator ROM (font data). |
| `1Z-013B.mzf` | `basic\` (or `roms\`) | Sharp's S-BASIC interpreter, supplied on cassette. |

Layout next to `MZRaku.exe`:

```
MZRaku.exe
roms\
  1z-013a.rom
  mz700fon.int
basic\
  1Z-013B.mzf
```

The first launch scans these folders, records the resolved paths in `settings.ini`, and starts the emulator. If a file is missing the emulator reports it and tells you exactly where it looked to find them.

### Using the emulator from a game launcher

One of the primary objectives of MZRaku is to make it much easier to launch MZ-700 games from launcher applications, so that games can be selected and will start automatically, even with the quirk of needing BASIC to be pre-loaded for most titles. This should be straightforward if you have configured other emulators within your launcher of choice, but see [Launcher setup](docs/usage/launcher-setup.md) for step-by-step instructions on wiring MZRaku into popular Windows game launchers (Launchbox so far, more to follow soon - notably Playnite).

## Building & running

```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Or once built:

```
.\[Working dir]\MZRaku.exe [--basic] [path\to\cassette.mzf]
```

### Producing a release build

```
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o publish\MZRaku
```

Release publishes a single self-extracting `MZRaku.exe` which assumes the .NET 8 DesktopRuntime is installed on the target machine. Place your ROMs / BASIC alongside the exe as per [Quickstart](#quickstart) above.

## Command-line options

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--basic` (`-b`) | Auto-load S-BASIC after the monitor is ready. Implied automatically if a BASIC program cassette file is also specified. |
| `<path>.mzf` | Auto-load a cassette image. BASIC programs will auto-load BASIC, then `RUN` will be typed automatically; machine-code images load and start directly. A `.zip` containing an `.mzf`/`.m12`/`.mzt` entry is also accepted (the first cassette entry within the archive is used). |
| `--display=N` | Override the window scale for this run: `1`, `2`, `3`, or `full`/`fs` for borderless full-screen. settings.ini is not modified — Alt+Enter or the View menu still toggle out of full-screen. |
| `--scanlines[=on\|off]` | Force the CRT-style scanlines overlay on or off for this run. Without the flag the persisted Settings → Display value wins. Doesn't write back to settings.ini unless you also touch the View → Scanlines toggle or open Settings. |
| `--dump=<file>` | At frame 120 (configurable using `--dumpframe` below), dump CPU/PIT/PPI/VRAM state to a text file and exit — useful for offline diagnostics. |
| `--dumpframe=N` | Override the dump frame number used for `--dump` above. |
| `--help` (`-h`) | Show usage. |

## Menu and shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Load cassette… | Ctrl+O |
| Load BASIC | Ctrl+B |
| Load BASIC source… | Ctrl+Shift+B |
| Reset | Ctrl+R |
| Settings → ROMs… | Ctrl+S |
| Settings → Display… | Ctrl+Shift+D |
| Settings → Keyboard… | Ctrl+Shift+K |
| Settings → Joystick… | Ctrl+Shift+J |
| Display 1× / 2× / 3× | Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2 / Ctrl+3 |
| Full-screen toggle | Alt+Enter |
| Scanlines toggle | Ctrl+L |
| Debugger… | Ctrl+D |
| Memory Viewer… | Ctrl+M |
| HID Diagnostic… | Ctrl+H |
| Sound Diagnostic… | — |

You can also drag and drop an `.mzf`/`.m12`/`.mzt` (or a `.zip` containing one) onto the window. Loading a cassette resets the emulator first, so opening a different program mid-execution will work regardless of whether the old or new program is BASIC or machine code.

All settings are stored in `settings.ini`, which is created when the emulator runs for the first time.

**File → Settings…** (Ctrl+S) opens a tabbed dialog covering Display, ROMs, and Joystick — or you can edit the INI by hand if you prefer (notes are included within each section of the created settings.ini file):

ROM and BASIC paths are written relative to the executable when possible (so the install stays portable). Absolute paths will be used if the ROM or BASIC file is outside the emulator directory. If a file is moved or deleted, the next emulator launch will re-scan the standard locations.

## Known limitations

- MZ-only glyphs (graphics blocks, kana) aren't reachable from a PC keystroke in the char-driven model — by design. The **Font Sheet**
  window (View → Font Sheet…, Ctrl+G) will ultimately bridge most of this gap with a click-to-type feature. However, this is not yet fully-working for all glyphs.
- MUSIC tempo rate is CPU-cycle-derived rather than driven from an emulated oscillator. It's ear-correct, but not precise.
- Auto-typed input (BASIC source paste / command auto-load) runs at around 6–8 chars/sec — fine for short snippets, slow for long
  listings.
- CRT-style scanlines (Settings → Display) look right in windowed mode but degrade at full-screen scale. A proper filter (with
  intensity / line-size controls) is required.

## Planned future work

Items I'd like to come back to (rough priority order):

- **BASIC-aware debugger panes** — program lister with de-tokenised output, current-line indicator, variable-table reader.
- **Current-line highlighting** in the source view once the BASIC line pointer is wired up.
- **BASIC source editor pane** — read the live BASIC program out of RAM, render it in an editable text pane, and write edits back.
- **MUSIC tempo re-validation** — stopwatch against a real MZ-700 now that discrete notes make timing comparison meaningful.
