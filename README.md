# MZ700Emul

A Sharp MZ-700 emulator written in C# / .NET 8 (WinForms). The aims of this emulator are:

1. Work well enough play the MZ-700 games I remember from my childhood
2. Be useable from a launcher such as Launchbox or Playnite, taking into account the need for a lot of games to have BASIC present before they can be loaded

This means that the goal is for the emulator to work 'well enough', and with some quality-of-life features to enable the above, without necessarily worrying about accurately reproducing how the actual MZ-700 hardware works.

***
IMPORTANT NOTE - The emulator code is *entirely* AI generated. Although I have some development experience, how CPUs etc work is outside my skillset so what is here is a result of several days of me working with Claude to produce the features and refinements I need for my use case. I chose to use C# as it is a language I know, so I can use how the project has been put together to educate myself on what it takes to create an emulator. The choice to use WinForms, effectively tying the current implementation tightly to Windows, was also made as it suits my specific needs.

Another aim was to see whether something like this is even possible using an AI tool. I think the result is pretty impressive. It's not perfect, far from it, but it does work. I think this is an appropriate use of these tools. I don't think anyone would be using a trivial emulator such as this for anything critical to their lives.

## Status

The emulator is generally functional with some known imperfections (listed below).

Boots the 1Z-013A monitor, runs S-BASIC (1Z-013B), plays
sound, and accepts PC keystrokes via the host keyboard layout (no
per-key config needed). Cassette images load via menu, drag-drop, or
the command line — the MZF type byte is inspected so BASIC programs
auto-load BASIC and `RUN`, and machine-code programs jump to their
entry directly. `.zip` archives containing a cassette are accepted
transparently. MZ-1X03 joysticks are emulated and driven from any
Windows-recognised game controller. Tested against several commercial
titles (Nightmare Park, Star Trek, Space Panic, etc.).

**Z80 core: passes both ZEXDOC and ZEXALL** — the de-facto Z80
instruction exercisers from the CP/M Users Group, covering documented
and undocumented behaviour (including the X/Y flag bits). The harness
is built in (`Debug → Run Z80 Test…`) and can be re-run any time
against the supplied `tools/CPM/zexdoc.com` / `zexall.com`. The Z80
core is also a separate class-library project (`Z80Core.dll`),
reusable for other Z80-based machines.

**Single-file release publish** — `dotnet publish -c Release` produces
a single self-extracting `MZ700Emul.exe` (about 300 KB) with no DLLs,
no `.pdb`, no JSON config files alongside. Framework-dependent
(assumes .NET 8 Desktop Runtime is installed); sound goes through
Windows' built-in `winmm.dll` directly (the same DLL the joystick
code uses).

## Quickstart

The emulator itself is freely available, but the MZ-700 firmware that
makes it useful is Sharp Corporation's copyright and is **not**
distributed here. You'll need to source three files yourself (search
for "MZ-700 ROMs" — they're widely archived by MZ enthusiasts) and
drop them into the install directory:

| File | Where it goes | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `1z-013a.rom` | `roms\` | The MZ-700 monitor ROM (4 KiB). |
| `mz700fon.int` | `roms\` | The character-generator ROM (font data). |
| `1Z-013B.mzf` | `basic\` (or `roms\`) | Sharp's S-BASIC interpreter, supplied on cassette. |

Layout next to `MZ700Emul.exe`:

```
MZ700Emul.exe
roms\
  1z-013a.rom
  mz700fon.int
basic\
  1Z-013B.mzf
```

The first launch scans these folders, records the resolved paths in
`settings.ini`, and starts the emulator. If a file is missing the
emulator reports it with a modal error and tells you exactly where
it looked.

### Using the emulator from a game launcher

See [LAUNCHERSETUP.md](LAUNCHERSETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions
on wiring MZ700Emul into popular Windows game launchers (Launchbox so
far, more to follow).

## Build & run

```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Or once built:

```
.\[Working dir]\MZ700Emul.exe [--basic] [path\to\cassette.mzf]
```

The launcher waits for the monitor to display its `MONITOR 1Z*` prompt
before injecting BASIC or a cassette, so startup is responsive
regardless of host speed.

### Producing a release build

```
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o publish\MZ700Emul
```

Release publishes a single self-extracting `MZ700Emul.exe` (debug
symbols embedded, framework-dependent). Assumes the .NET 8 Desktop
Runtime is installed on the target machine. Drop the user-supplied
ROMs / BASIC alongside the exe per [Quickstart](#quickstart).

## Command-line options

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--basic` (`-b`) | Auto-load S-BASIC after the monitor is ready. Implied automatically when the cassette is a BASIC program. |
| `<path>.mzf` | Auto-load a cassette image. The MZF type byte is inspected: BASIC programs (type 0x02 / 0x05) auto-load BASIC, then direct-inject + `RUN`; machine-code images (type 0x01) skip BASIC and jump straight to their entry. A `.zip` containing an `.mzf`/`.m12`/`.mzt` entry is also accepted (first cassette entry is used). |
| `--dump=<file>` | At frame 120 (configurable), dump CPU/PIT/PPI/VRAM state to a text file and exit — useful for offline diagnostics. |
| `--dumpframe=N` | Override the dump frame number. |
| `--help` (`-h`) | Show usage. |

## Menu and shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Load cassette… | Ctrl+O |
| Load BASIC | Ctrl+B |
| Load BASIC source… | Ctrl+Shift+B |
| Reset | Ctrl+R |
| Display 1× / 2× / 3× | Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2 / Ctrl+3 |
| Debugger… | Ctrl+D |
| Memory Viewer… | Ctrl+M |

You can also drag and drop an `.mzf` (or a `.zip` containing one) onto
the window. Loading a cassette resets the emulator first, so opening
a different program mid-execution Just Works regardless of whether the
old or new program is BASIC or machine code.

User preferences live in `settings.ini` next to the executable — a
plain INI file you can edit by hand if you prefer:

```ini
[Display]
Scale=2

[Roms]
Monitor=roms\1z-013a.rom
Font=roms\mz700fon.int
Basic=basic\1Z-013B.mzf
```

Paths are written relative to the executable when possible (so the
install stays portable) and absolute when the file lives elsewhere.
If a path goes stale (file moved or deleted), the next launch
re-scans the standard locations and patches the file up.

## Known limitations & imperfections

- MZ-only glyphs (graphics blocks, kana) aren't reachable from a PC
  keyboard in the current char-driven model — by design.
- Sound reproduction isn't quite right. It works well enough to play most games, but sometimes sounds are missing and I'm not confident about the timings.
- Auto-typed input (BASIC source paste / command auto-load) is still
  hit-and-miss with shifted characters and is slow enough to be a
  bottleneck when dumping long listings.
- A few PC keys still don't map cleanly to their MZ-700 equivalents
  (`*` is the known offender; broader verification pending).

## Planned future work

Items I'd like to come back to (rough priority order):

- **Auto-typer reliability + speed** — fix shifted-character drops and
  raise throughput so pasting BASIC source / auto-LIST dumps stop
  being a bottleneck. Likely needs direct keyboard-buffer injection
  rather than driving the matrix.
- **Keyboard mapping verification + GUI editor** — sweep the PC→MZ
  character map (`*` and any other strays) and expose it as a
  user-editable mapping persisted to a file.
- **Game controller button mapping (GUI)** — let the user assign host
  gamepad buttons to MZ-1X03 buttons via a config dialog, rather than
  the current hardcoded mapping.
- **BASIC-aware debugger panes** — program lister with de-tokenised
  output, current-line indicator, variable-table reader.
- **Current-line highlighting** in the source view once the BASIC
  line pointer is wired up.
- **Persisted debugger state** — remember window placement and the
  breakpoint list across runs (in `settings.ini`).
- **BASIC source editor pane** — read the live BASIC program out of
  RAM, render it in an editable text pane, and write edits back.
- **Settings dialog** — replace direct `settings.ini` editing with a
  tabbed UI once there are enough groups to justify it (sound, joystick
  mapping, user-editable keyboard glyphs).
- **Hotkeys for the remaining menu items.**
